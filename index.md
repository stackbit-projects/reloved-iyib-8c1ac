  Re-loved is about raising environmental awareness and highlighting the dark
  side in the fashion industry. The aim is to reduce clothing waste, reuse and
  recycle clothing. Encouraging the use of second hand clothing as well as
  donating and selling unwanted clothes. A big change can be made if we start to
  implement these practices. My name is Iyi Bolarin and my goal is to create a
  more sustainable fashion industry.
